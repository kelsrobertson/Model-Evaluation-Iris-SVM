# Model-Evaluation-Iris-SVM
A machine learning project using the Iris dataset to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This notebook demonstrates the use of confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics to assess classification performance.

## Overview
This notebook explores how to evaluate the performance of a classification model using the **Iris flower dataset**. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained to distinguish between two classes, and its predictions are evaluated using a **confusion matrix**, accuracy, and other performance metrics.

## Learning Objectives
- Load and process the Iris dataset
- Train an SVM classifier
- Split data into training and test sets
- Evaluate predictions using a confusion matrix
- Interpret classifier performance visually and numerically

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Iris Dataset
- **Classes Used**: Likely binary (e.g., `setosa` vs `versicolor`)
- **Features**: Sepal/Petal length and width

## Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Key Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- (Optional) Precision, Recall, F1-Score
